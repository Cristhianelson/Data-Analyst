This Capstone Project will carry out a case study to understand and use a large dataset with over 2.2 million observations from one of the most popular online retailers around the world Amazon, the dataset used here was last updated in October of 2023, and it will be used to conduct the objects of this project using exploratory data analysis and machine learning to aim increasing company sales.

This large data set has been chosen to show the significance of managing a large amount of data and getting real results using a real-world problem. This study will be interesting and at the same time challenging, where one of the objectives is to develop possible solutions to train a model which creates an optimised title of the product making it interesting and more saleable than the large titles.

The dataset is composed of some objective features such as the title of the product, product rating, number of reviews, buy now the price of the product, whether the product had a status bestseller or not, number of products sold last month and the name of the category that the product belongs to.

Using the project management CRISP-DM methodology, “the most popular framework for executing data science projects.” (Data Science Process Alliance, 2021). Respecting the six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modelling and Evaluation.

The environment tool to be used in this project is Anaconda Navigator with Jupyter interactive computing notebook environment, using the programming language Python, with some technologies such as Pandas: For data analysis and manipulation, Numpy: For working with arrays, Seaborn: For statistical data visualisations, Matplotlib: For visualisation with Python, Scikit-Learn: For Machine Learning in Python, and Others: once needed it.

In addition, for spelling a free AI Writing Assistance Grammarly (Grammarly, 2009) is being used to help with English grammar while typing. The project is available on this link and the complete URL is available on References (Macedo, 2024).
